      <h1 class="head2">  Set Your Budget</h1>
      <p class="p2" >
                  The first step to planning your wedding on a budget is to figure out what the <br>
                 “budget” is : <br>
<br>

                 1.Determine out who is paying for the wedding. Is it just you and your partner?  <br>
                 Are your families helping? How much can everyone contribute?<br> 
                 2.Next, crunch the numbers to figure out your total spending limit. Keep in <br>
                 mind that it’s never a good idea to acquire debt while paying <br>
                 for your wedding—stick to a budget amount that doesn’t require loans or credit card <br>
                 charges that you cannot repay within a few <br>

</p>
<h1 class="head2">Research Average Costs</h1>
<p class="p2" >
The average cost of a wedding and vendor prices vary a lot by location. <br> 
For example, a wedding florist in Los Angeles, CA might be less expensive <br>
compared to vendors in Boston, MA or Tampa, FL. Do a little research to figure <br>
out typical costs in your area and what percentage of your total budget should  <br>
be allocated to the vendors you absolutely need to pull off your wedding day. <br>
 A lot of couples experience sticker shock when they receive price quotes from  <br>
vendors. Knowing what to expect will help you stay within budget and let you <br>
start to hone in on areas where you might be able to cut costs.
</p>
    <h1 class="head2"> Cut Costs Where You Can</h1>
    <p class="p2" >
    A common strategy for couples planning a wedding on a budget is to think outside of the box. Here are a few ways you might save:<br>

    2.Recycle and buy used whenever you can.<br>
    3.Have a small wedding cake and supplement with sheet cakes or other desserts.<br>
    4.Opt for informal wedding attire.<br>
    5.Send digital wedding invitations.<br>
    6.Host a potluck wedding.<br>
    7.Choose an off-season or weekday wedding date.<br>
    8.Limit your bar to beer and wine only.<br>

    10.Repurpose ceremony decor at the reception.<br>
    11.DIY your ceremony and reception music.<br>
    12.Have a friend of family member officiate the wedding.<br>
